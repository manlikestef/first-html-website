# first-html-website
first html project on roadmap.sh
http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
This README will tell you how to use my website.
Right now there isn't much on there. Just a navigation bar, a link to my instagram, and some random other stuff on each page.
Roadmap.sh is telling me to explain to you how to use my site, but you can figure it out. Just click the buttons. Thats it.

Thanks for going on my site, any advice or critique is much appreciated.
